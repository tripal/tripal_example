# Tripal Examples

### This module is currently under active development! 
### Examples are not ready for use.

The Examples for Developers project aims to provide high-quality, well-documented API examples for a broad range of Tripal core functionality. For Drupal core functionality, we suggest you look at the Drupal Examples module: https://www.drupal.org/project/examples.

The Examples project contains many modules which hopefully illustrate best practices for implementing various Tripal APIs. These modules can be enabled individually, and will typically add menu items to your site, which should guide you through their features. You can then look through the code to see what they are doing.

## We want your input!
Development on this module has just begun for Tripal 3.x. We would Love input on the issue queue regarding examples you would find useful!
